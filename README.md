# Comparison-between-Apache-Spark-and-Apache-Hadoop-using-YouTube-Data
The Domain we worked on is Social Media. We analyzed the data from YouTube and found out some key insight through it. The reason we choose this topic is because, thereâ€™s a lot of debate over which technology is better in the Big Data World, Apache Spark or Hadoop. So to finally come to a conclusion on this subject, we our self thought to find it out by using both these technologies and comparing them. We compared both the technologies, Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop using the same dataset. But as these technologies have various components, we used them to compare which one has an edge over another. Also we analyzed the data and found some insights from it.
